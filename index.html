        <p >My favorite hobby is to write. I like to write because when I write It takes me to a new place whether its a mountain or a valley writing allows me to be free with my creativity and my imagination. Not only that writing is something that can help me with improving my vocabulary. I like to write by typing because it is most comfertable for me. I like to write about anything like a blog, how my day was, people I met, or an adventure I had! This is why it is my favorite hobby. </p>
